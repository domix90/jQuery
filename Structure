jQuery is a widely used JavaScript library that helps you quickly and easily adds interactivity to web pages. 
jQuery became popular in the mid-2000s, when there were a number of differences between how browsers like 
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari handled DOM programming.

I need to learn jQuery methods and jQuery specific selectors. 

HOW TO CALL jQuery: 

jQuery('.box').hide();
(with plan JS it would be: let box = document.querySelector('.box');
box.style.display = 'none';)

I can also use a $ sign to call jQuery function :

$('.box').hide();

$('.box').click(()=>{
                
                alert('You clicked me');
                
                });


I can check different effects that jQuery provides here:

I can CHAIN jQuery effects on a single element in the following way: 

$('.element').hide().slideDown().delay().slideUp();

OR

$('.element')
  .hide()
  .slideDown()
  .delay()
  .slideUp()
  
 ;
