jQuery is a widely used JavaScript library that helps you quickly and easily adds interactivity to web pages. 
jQuery became popular in the mid-2000s, when there were a number of differences between how browsers like 
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Safari handled DOM programming.

I need to learn jQuery methods and jQuery specific selectors. 

HOW TO CALL jQuery: 

jQuery('.box').hide();
(with plan JS it would be: let box = document.querySelector('.box');
box.style.display = 'none';)

I can also use a $ sign to call jQuery function :

$('.box').hide();

$('.box').click(()=>{
                
                alert('You clicked me');
                
                });


I can check different effects that jQuery provides here: 
https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/

I can CHAIN jQuery effects on a single element in the following way: 

$('.element').hide().slideDown().delay().slideUp();

OR

$('.element')
  .hide()
  .slideDown()
  .delay()
  .slideUp()
  
 ;
 
 GETTER  VS SETTER METHODS
 
 $('#Element').html();
 $('#Element').text();
 
1. The text method allows me to get, insert, or change text
within the element I've selected

2. The HTML method allows me to get
insert, or change HTML within the element I've selected.

3. Using the HTML method with no argument would
get any value that is within the element we call it on - THATS GETTER becuase it GETs the value

4. The HTML method with arguments is known as a setter because it sets a value. - THATS SETTER
