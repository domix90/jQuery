// First I need to create a variable with the required element. For example if I want to create a button I can do it in the following way: 

const $button = $('<button>This is a new button</button>');

// When the element is created, we need to add it to the page.
// When you create a new element with jQuery, it's not automatically added to the DOM,
// and the users won't see it on a page until I add it.
// There's another jQuery method for that and
// it's called append, or prepend.

// Append adds the element to the end of the parent DOM element 
// while prepend adds the element to the beginning. 
// We need to select the parent DOM element 

$(.exampleDomParent).append($button);
